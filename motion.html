				<h1>ANIMATE PROJECT</h1>

				<p>
					A continuation of the previous project but now in animated form. I still wanted to add elements that ninjas are known to do which is their quick reflexes
					and flips. So to do that I made the motion for it to spin and land quickly into a stil position. I also wanted the other elements to come together and form
					into a presentable business logo, I made the transition in the beginning to fade in with the background image slowly. The ninja comes through and now the logo below,
					also added a little slogan that reads "Staches Get Slashin" as well.
