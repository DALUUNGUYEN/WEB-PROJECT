				<h1>ILLUSTRATOR PROJECT</h1>

				<p>Here is what I made in illustrator, a custom fake business logo. There was provided characters for us to build for the project and I happen to chose the ninja.
					Brainstorming with what to do I came up with some concepts, since I wanted to stick with a business theme of some sort and thinking of what ninjas do which is
					cutting things. Finally an idea caught up to me, a barber shop business brand called "Ninja Stache". So I started putting the pieces together with more of the
					provided resources to use for the project. I added the tools of a comb and scissors as that's what barber's use, the mustache with a triangular shape behind it
					and then the text. Made it with a split to give it that slashed feel and another layer of the text behind that acting as a shadow, found a free stock image
					changing the colors to fit with the ninja.
