				<h1>PHOTOSHOP PROJECT</h1>

				<p>
					This was my Photoshop Project, I decided to use one of my selfies that was saved laying around in my Google Drive which you have seen on the homepage.
					Colored hue lights in the photo gave me that party type vibe so I went along an idea for it. Started with adding a disco ball with a light flare on it
					to make it reflective and with motion blur to make it look like I was partying. The idea behind the polaroid boarder, was to capture memories which many
					do with using polaroid cameras. Finally adding text below that said "Party Time" with a font that makes it was written in marker.
